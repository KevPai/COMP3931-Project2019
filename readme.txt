**NOTE: When doing DFT make sure to right-click [COPY] to save your selected samples. 
Then click [DFT] to apply fourier transform!**

1. properly play saved wave file.
	i. click on [start] under [Record] to start recording.
	ii. then, click [file] on the top-left corner and click [save as]. Choose a destination to save the file.
	iii. open the wave file you just saved, and it should play normally.

2. apply windowing technique on a selected portion of the wave.
	i. click on [file], hover on [open], then click [.wav] to open a wave file.
	ii. select a portion of the wave using left-click and drag.
	iii. click on [windowing] beside [file], then choose a windowing techinique and it will automatically apply the technique you chose.

3. DFT and inverseDFT
	i. select a portion of your wave, then click [DFT] to draw the frequency graph
	ii. After you draw your frequency graph, you can click [Inverse DFT] to 
		re-draw your wave from the selected portion

4. Filtering
	i. Select a portion from your frequency chart, then right-click and [Filter]
	ii. This will automatically iDFT the filtered frequencies and re-draw the wave

5. Zooming and Scrolling
	i. Use mouse-wheel on the wave chart to zoom in or zoom out.
	ii. This will create a scroll-bar on the bottom of the chart to navigate.
